# yoast-seo-plugin-for-WP
Yoast SEO plugin stopped working on my Wordpress website
I deactivaed all of my plugins and switched to the 2016 theme as mentioned but my plugin still does not work. I have a screenshot but I don't know how to upload it. This is my first time submitting a bug report. I use yoast a lot so any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
